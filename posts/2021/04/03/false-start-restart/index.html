The benefits of Medium are that it allows an author to focus on content rather than the technical requirements of publishing content and hosting. One of the downsides is that you are ultimately handing control over to someone who is trying to monetize the plafform and content on it as part of their business. This led me to investigate an alternate model of hosting the master content elsewhere and cross-posting back to Medium.\nFalse start #2 - Wordpress.com So, if Medium was going to be a secondary publishing platform, what should be used to host the master content? My next logical step was to revisit Wordpress, which I used briefly (over 10 years ago) for my Objectfactory blog. I always liked Wordpress as a platform but I wanted to automatically cross-post to Medium and using the standard multi-tenant Wordpress.com platform didnâ€™t provide the flexibility to use non-standard plugins such as Official Medium Plugin. This resulted in considering other Wordpress hosting options before progressing down a self-hosted Wordpress route primarily for two reasons:\nIâ€™m a technologist and engineer and therefore like to understand how to build something for myself, and Iâ€™m from Yorkshire and therefore fiscally conservative ðŸ˜‰ and figured I could do it cheaper than standard managed hosting False start #3 - Self-Hosted Wordpress I decided to build and deploy my own Wordpress instance hosted on AWS public cloud-hosting. Rather than using one or more dedicated EC2 compute instances, I used a Bitnami Wordpress stack, which provides a pre-packaged image for Amazon Lightsail and is the quickest way of getting up and running using a single virtual private server on AWS. As is so often the case, getting up and running was the easy part.\nThis wasnâ€™t so much an MVP as just an MP - lacking the viable aspect. If I was going to self-host this Wordpress instance, it needed to be protected from unauthorised access which meant deploying a series of Wordpress plugins ranging from JetPack which provides anti-spam protection and site-monitoring amongst other things, to plugins such as WPS Hide Login which obscure the login URL for Wordpress.\nI needed to ensure the site was backed up, not just using AWS snapshots but also backing up content using UpdraftPlus and offloading static content to a CDN using WP Offload Media Lite to minimize the load and data transfer from the Wordpress server. This had already gone way beyond â€˜Mâ€™ in the MVP.\nThis was before Iâ€™d even got into the smorgasboard of Wordpress themes such as Neve and how to use block editors such as Gutenberg and page builders like Elementor.\nNote: Somewhere along the above journey, I also found out that the Official Medium Wordpress plugin was no longer supported for cross-posting to Medium ðŸ˜–\nBy the time Iâ€™d finished, I was fairly happy with the setup as deployed which resembled the below and used the following list of Amazon services:\nRoute53 for DNS hosted-zone name resolution and Domain Name registration Certificate Management for SSL certificate management Lightsail for virtual private server compute with static Elastic IP address S3 for hosting of static resources CloudFront for Content Distribution (CDN) for both static and dynamic content Identity Access Manager (IAM) for CloudFront/S3 authorization Around this point, I came to the realization that my task list looked like this:\nRegister TLD (robexley.com) Build a self-hosted wordpress instance more cheaply than available managed hosting. Learn about Wordpress Extend my knowledge and experience of AWS and the services available Publish site and make available externally Write content and Iâ€™d spent more time than Iâ€™d have liked battling with Wordpress themes, css and customization.\nNote: The above task list has been created purely for artistic license.\nâ€¦and then restart With the opportunity to take a step back and reflect on what Iâ€™d created, I came to the realization that what Iâ€™d actually missed was the opportunity to simplify and create something which met my needs and would require significantly less ongoing maintenance. I didnâ€™t need a dynamic site using a complex stack like Wordpress, I needed something simple, lightweight and one in which I could author content in markdown and manage within github.\nEnter Hugo\nto be continuedâ€¦.\n","wordCount":"738","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-04-03T18:46:57+01:00","dateModified":"2021-04-03T18:46:57+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rob Exley"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://robexley.github.io/posts/2021/04/03/false-start-restart/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Rob Exley","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://robexley.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:#1d1e20;--entry:#2e2e33;--primary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg:#2e2e33;--code-bg:#37383e;--border:#333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://robexley.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=/apple-touch-icon.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a>
