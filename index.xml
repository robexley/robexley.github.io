      <description>I’m an IBM Architect with over 25 years of design and delivery experience across several sectors but with a primary focus on Public Sector and Financial Services. Working as a lead architect across large complex systems integration projects, I typically operate across the full spectrum of architecture disciplines but specialise in Solution and Application architecture for which I’m certified by IBM as a Senior Certified Architect (Level 3 - Thought Leader) and by the Open Group as a Level 3 Distinguished Architect.</description>
