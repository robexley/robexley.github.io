![Profile](/images/profile.png#floatleft)

I’m an IBM Executive Architect with over 25 years of design and delivery experience across several sectors but with a primary focus on Public Sector. Working as a lead/chief architect across large complex systems integration projects, I typically operate across the full spectrum of architecture disciplines, specialising in Solution and Application architecture for which I’m certified by IBM as a (L3) Thought Leader and by Open Group as a Distinguished Architect.

In my experience delivering digital transformations for clients, I lead solutions that integrate across diverse enterprise landscapes and hosting platforms incorporating public, private and hybrid cloud. I provide balanced guidance to clients, drawing on years of experience to ensure complex factors are considered when identifying the most appropriate solution that will deliver value for both the business and its customers.

In my work for both IBM and beforehand, I have always worked in environments with stringent non-functional requirements, particularly performance and availability. As a result, I am focused on delivering solutions that address requirements across the functional and non-functional spectrum, but with a particular emphasis on performance and availability engineering.

Although I work for IBM, any views expressed on this site are my own.
