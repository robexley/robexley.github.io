![Profile](/images/profile.png#floatleft)

I’m an IBM Architect with over 25 years of design and delivery experience across several sectors but with a primary focus on Public Sector and Financial Services. Working as a lead architect across large complex systems integration projects, I typically operate across the full spectrum of architecture disciplines but specialise in Solution and Application architecture for which I’m certified by IBM as a Senior Certified Architect (Level 3 - Thought Leader) and by the Open Group as a Level 3 Distinguished Architect.

Through my experience delivering digital transformations for clients, I’m experienced in leading solutions which integrate across diverse enterprise landscapes, technologies and hosting platforms incorporating public, private and hybrid cloud. I have led teams delivering digital services across public and private sector incorporating DevOps and Continuous Delivery practices alongside agile delivery methods and frameworks.

As an experienced chief architect, I work alongside senior stakeholders and technical professionals to ensure solutions are not only innovative but also pragmatic and deliverable. I provide an objective and independent viewpoint, drawing on years of experience to ensure complex factors are considered when identifying the most appropriate solution that will deliver value for both the business and its customers.

In my work for both IBM and beforehand, I have always worked in environments with stringent non-functional requirements, particularly performance and availability. As a result, I am focused on delivering solutions that address requirements across the spectrum with a particular emphasis on performance and availability engineering.

Although I work for IBM, any views expressed on this site are my own.
